# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Thanks for checking out my Github

**My name is Joseph, and i'm a future software engineer.**

I got into tech at an early age, starting with omputerized drafting / 3D modeling. Being able to visualize problems, and work out solutions in real time was something I loved - I wanted to return to that feeling, and switch my major to Computer Science and only regret not doing it sooner. I don't exactly have a main area of interest right now, but I am interested in software deveopment, specifically AI and platform intergrations (bridging the gap between devices).

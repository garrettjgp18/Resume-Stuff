# Expression Reader ðŸ¤–

This was a passion project of mine. I really wanted to get a understanding of how AI works, especially detection software, so I used several libraries, like **CV2 and Theading** in conjunction.
- Using a camera, it detects the users face and displays their current expression. Depending on said expression, a audio file will play.
- **Threading** was used to allow the camera and audio ques to work in conjunction - without threading, the camera would freeze while the audio played.
- **DeepFace** was used to pretrain the AI on facial expressions, making the process a lot smoother than training it from the ground up.

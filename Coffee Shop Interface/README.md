# Simple Coffee Shop Interface

---

This project was completed in my CS203 (Object Oriented Programming) class. It is a simple order interface that uses principles of OOP to create and customize coffee orders. 
- Please run the code in 'debug' mode (at least, thats what works for me in VScode, as I oringally wrote this in Eclipse and there were some file pathing issues when adding it to a repository
- There are plans to revamp the GUI now that I have more experience in Java and GUI development.
